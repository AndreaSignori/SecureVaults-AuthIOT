\section{Conclusions}
In conclusion, the laboratory successfully demonstrated the applicability of the authentication process analyzed, confirming its effectiveness in a controlled environment. It should be noted that, in the case of devices handling sensitive data, security can be further enhanced by using a session key, calculated at the end of the authentication process, to encrypt the communication. It is important to remember that this is a Proof of Concept (PoC), therefore not intended for production use without further verification and optimizations, but it represents a solid foundation for future developments.
