\section{Client}
How the client is implemented are similar on what we describe in Table \ref{tab:tools-table} despite that the database has been substituted with a simple file with aim to simulate a device memory.

The client wants to simulate as much as possible a real temperature sensor because we don't have the sensor and any kind of board available.

Another fact that it isn't clear from the original paper, is the concept of \textbf{session}. We assume that the session is defined by the IoT device because is the component that starts all the authentication and then, after the authentication process, sends its data for a certain amount of time before closing the session and updates its secure vault.
After closing the session the device waits a couple of seconds before initiate new session sending its device and session id.

            sock.sendall(helper.create_m1(DEVICE_ID, SESSION_ID))

            # STEP 2: receives M2

\subsection{Sensor implementation}
As mention above we want to get a realistic sensor simulation. To do so, we image a possible scenario where we put a temperature sensor indoor without any external intervention (for instance, opening a door or window). To reach our objective, we decided to sample the temperature from a normal distribution centered on 18Â°C with a standard deviation of 1 because gives us a more realistic temperature variation for an indoor environment (see Figure \ref{fig:temp-distribution}).
